## Origins
- Rooted in the idea of the **ummah** (global Muslim community).  
- Gained traction in the **late 19th century**, promoted by reformers like **Jamal al-Din al-Afghani**.  
- Adopted by the **Ottoman Empire** as a strategy to resist European colonial powers.  

## Core Principles
- **Unity of Muslims** across ethnic, national, and cultural lines.  
- Establishment of a **single Islamic authority** (often a caliphate).  
- Opposition to Western imperialism and secular nationalism.  

## Historical Role
- During **World War I**, Pan-Islamism was used by the Ottomans and their allies to rally Muslims against colonial powers[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://encyclopedia.1914-1918-online.net/article/pan-islamism-ottoman-empire/?format=pdf&citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054&citationId=2 "1914-1918-Online").  
- Influenced movements like the **Muslim Brotherhood** in Egypt and reformist thinkers across South Asia and the Middle East.  

## Modern Context
- Today, Pan-Islamism exists in various forms:  
  - Political movements calling for Islamic unity.  
  - Intellectual debates on the role of the **ummah** in global politics.  
  - Criticized for being impractical in diverse Muslim societies with different cultures and sects.  

## Legacy
- Inspired anti-colonial resistance in the 19th and 20th centuries.  
- Continues to shape debates on identity, governance, and globalization in the Muslim world.
