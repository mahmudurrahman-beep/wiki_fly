## Definition
**Neanderthals** were an extinct species or subspecies of archaic humans who lived in Eurasia until about **40,000 years ago**. They are closely related to modern humans (*Homo sapiens*), sharing about **99.7% of DNA**.

## Origins
- First appeared around **400,000 years ago**.  
- Evolved in Europe and western Asia from earlier hominins.  
- Coexisted with early modern humans for thousands of years.  

## Physical Characteristics
- Stocky, muscular build adapted to cold climates.  
- Larger cranial capacity than modern humans (~1600 cm³).  
- Distinctive features: prominent brow ridges, wide noses, and shorter limbs.  

## Culture and Behavior
- Skilled hunters, used spears and stone tools.  
- Controlled fire and lived in shelters or caves.  
- Evidence of symbolic behavior: burial of the dead, possible art and ornaments.  
- Likely had spoken language, though different from modern humans.  

## Interaction with Modern Humans
- Interbred with *Homo sapiens*; today, most non‑African populations carry **1–2% Neanderthal DNA**.  
- Genetic contributions affect immunity, skin, and hair traits.  
- Competition and climate change likely contributed to their extinction.  

## Discovery
- First fossils discovered in **1856** in the Neander Valley, Germany.  
- Since then, remains found across Europe, Middle East, and western Asia.  

## Legacy
- Neanderthals are no longer seen as brutish or primitive, but as intelligent humans with complex societies.  
- Their genetic legacy continues in modern populations.  
- They remain central to understanding human evolution.

*Neanderthals were not just distant relatives but part of the human story, leaving behind both fossils and genes that shape us today.*
