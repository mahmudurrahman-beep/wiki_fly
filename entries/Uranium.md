## Introduction
**Uranium** is a chemical element with the symbol **U** and atomic number **92**. It is a heavy, silvery‑white metal that is weakly radioactive. Uranium is best known for its role as fuel in nuclear power plants and as a key material in nuclear weapons.

## History / Origins
- Discovered in **1789** by German chemist **Martin Heinrich Klaproth**, who named it after the planet Uranus.  
- First isolated in metallic form in **1841** by French chemist **Eugène-Melchior Péligot**.  
- Became significant in the 20th century with the discovery of nuclear fission (1938), leading to its use in both energy and weaponry.  

## Key Features
- **Appearance**: Dense, silvery‑white metal.  
- **Radioactivity**: Naturally radioactive, though less than many other radioactive elements.  
- **Isotopes**:  
  - **U‑238** (most abundant, ~99.3%).  
  - **U‑235** (rare, ~0.7%, fissile and used in nuclear reactors/weapons).  
  - **U‑234** (trace amounts).  
- **Occurrence**: Found in minerals such as uraninite and carnotite.  
- **Uses**:  
  - Nuclear fuel (U‑235 in reactors).  
  - Nuclear weapons (critical fissile material).  
  - Coloring agent in ceramics and glass (historically).  
  - Research in geology and dating methods.  

## Legacy / Impact
- Central to the **nuclear age**, powering electricity generation and shaping global geopolitics.  
- Mining and enrichment of uranium remain controversial due to environmental and safety concerns.  
- Plays a role in discussions of clean energy, given nuclear power’s low carbon emissions.  

## Fun Fact 🌟
Uranium glass, also called *Vaseline glass*, glows bright green under UV light because of its uranium content.
