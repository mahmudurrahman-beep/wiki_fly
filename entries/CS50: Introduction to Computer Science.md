## Introduction
**CS50** is Harvard University’s introductory computer science course. It is designed to teach students how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently, regardless of prior programming experience.

## History / Origins
- First offered at Harvard in the early 2000s.  
- Taught by **David J. Malan**, who transformed it into Harvard’s largest course.  
- Expanded globally through **edX** as CS50x, reaching millions of learners.  
- Adapted into versions for high schools (CS50 AP) and specialized tracks (CS50 AI, CS50 Web, CS50 Game Development).  

## Key Features
- **Topics Covered**:  
  - Algorithms, abstraction, data structures, encapsulation.  
  - Resource management, security, software engineering.  
  - Web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, SQL, Django).  
- **Languages Used**: C, Python, SQL, JavaScript, plus libraries like Flask and React.  
- **Format**:  
  - Lectures with live demos and engaging visuals.  
  - Problem sets (psets) that challenge students to apply concepts.  
  - Final project showcasing creativity and technical skills.  
- **Duration**: Typically 11 weeks, requiring 10–20 hours per week for online learners.  

## Legacy / Impact
- Harvard’s largest on‑campus course, with thousands of students enrolled.  
- One of the most popular MOOCs worldwide, democratizing access to computer science education.  
- Inspired countless learners to pursue careers in programming, data science, and AI.  
- Known for its theatrical lectures, making computer science accessible and exciting.  

## Fun Fact 🌟
CS50 lectures are so popular that they’ve been described as **“computer science Broadway shows”**, blending rigorous content with entertainment.
