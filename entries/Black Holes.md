## Definition
A **black hole** is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing—not even light—can escape. They are formed when massive stars collapse under their own gravity, and are described by Einstein’s **General Theory of Relativity**.

## Formation
- **Stellar Collapse** – When a massive star exhausts its nuclear fuel, its core collapses.  
- **Supernova** – The outer layers explode, leaving behind a dense core.  
- **Critical Mass** – If the core is above a certain mass, it becomes a black hole.  

## Structure
- **Event Horizon** – The boundary beyond which nothing can escape.  
- **Singularity** – The central point of infinite density.  
- **Accretion Disk** – Matter spiraling into the black hole, heated to extreme temperatures.  
- **Relativistic Jets** – High‑energy streams of particles ejected along magnetic poles.  

## Types of Black Holes
1. **Stellar‑Mass Black Holes** – Formed from collapsing stars (a few to tens of solar masses).  
2. **Supermassive Black Holes** – Found at galaxy centers, millions to billions of solar masses.  
3. **Intermediate Black Holes** – Between stellar and supermassive sizes.  
4. **Primordial Black Holes** – Hypothetical, formed in the early universe.  

## Properties
- **Gravitational Pull** – Escape velocity exceeds the speed of light.  
- **Time Dilation** – Time slows near the event horizon for outside observers.  
- **Hawking Radiation** – Theoretical radiation that may cause black holes to slowly evaporate.  

## Observation
- Black holes cannot be seen directly.  
- Detected through effects on nearby matter and light.  
- Methods include:
  - **X‑ray emissions** from accretion disks.  
  - **Gravitational waves** from black hole mergers.  
  - **Imaging** – In 2019, the Event Horizon Telescope captured the first image of a black hole (M87*).  

## Importance
- Test predictions of relativity and quantum mechanics.  
- Influence galaxy formation and evolution.  
- Provide insights into the limits of physics and cosmology.

*Black holes are among the most mysterious and extreme objects in the universe, representing the ultimate frontier of gravity and spacetime.*
