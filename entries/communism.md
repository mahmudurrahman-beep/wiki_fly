## Core Principles
- **Common ownership:** Factories, land, and resources belong to society collectively.  
- **Classless society:** No division between rich and poor; everyone is equal.  
- **Distribution by need:** Goods and services are allocated based on necessity, not wealth.  
- **Abolition of private property:** Individuals cannot own productive assets.  
- **End of the state:** In theory, government becomes unnecessary once equality is achieved.  

## Historical Development
- Rooted in the ideas of **Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels** (*Communist Manifesto*, 1848).  
- Emerged as a response to exploitation during the Industrial Revolution.  
- Implemented in the **Soviet Union (1917–1991)**, **China (1949–present)**, and other nations.  

## Modern Examples
