## Introduction
The **Black Death** was a bubonic plague pandemic that ravaged Europe, Asia, and North Africa between 1346 and 1353. It is considered one of the deadliest events in human history.

## History / Origins
- Originated in **Central Asia**, spreading westward via trade routes.  
- Reached Europe in **1347**, carried by Genoese trading ships from the Black Sea.  
- Caused by the bacterium **Yersinia pestis**, transmitted by fleas on rats and possibly human parasites.  

## Key Features
- **Types of Plague**: Bubonic (swollen lymph nodes), Pneumonic (lung infection), Septicemic (blood infection).  
- **Symptoms**: Fever, chills, vomiting, painful swellings (“buboes”), and rapid death.  
- **Spread**: Through fleas, rats, and human contact; worsened by poor sanitation and crowded cities.  
- **Death Toll**: Estimated **25–50 million deaths** in Europe alone, about 50% of the population.  

## Legacy / Impact
- Triggered massive **social, religious, and economic upheaval**.  
- Labor shortages led to higher wages and weakened feudalism.  
- Inspired religious movements like the **Flagellants**, who sought penance through self‑punishment.  
- Left a lasting mark on art, literature, and collective memory.  

## Fun Fact 🌟
The Black Death was also called the **“Great Mortality”** in medieval chronicles; the term “Black Death” only became common centuries later.
