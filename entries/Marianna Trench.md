## Location & Geography
- Situated about **200 km east of the Mariana Islands** in the western Pacific Ocean.  
- Crescent-shaped trench, about **2,550 km long** and **69 km wide**.  
- Managed by U.S. territories: **Guam** and the **Northern Mariana Islands**.  

## Depth
- **Challenger Deep**: The deepest known point, measured at **10,984 ± 25 meters (36,037 ft)**.  
- Equivalent to nearly **7 miles deep**.  
- Pressure at the bottom is over **1,000 times atmospheric pressure at sea level**.  

## Formation
- Created by **subduction**, where the Pacific Plate is forced beneath the smaller Mariana Plate.  
- This tectonic activity also causes earthquakes and volcanic activity in the region.  

## Exploration
- First measured in **1875** by HMS Challenger.  
- **1960:** Jacques Piccard and Don Walsh descended in the bathyscaphe *Trieste*.  
- **2012:** Filmmaker James Cameron made a solo dive to Challenger Deep.  
- Modern robotic submersibles continue to explore its extreme environment.  

## Unique Life
- Despite crushing pressure and darkness, life exists:  
  - Microbes adapted to extreme conditions.  
  - Amphipods and other deep-sea creatures.  
- Studying these organisms helps scientists understand **extremophiles** and potential life on other planets.  

## Importance
- Provides insights into **plate tectonics** and Earth’s geology.  
- Helps scientists study **climate change**, as trenches store carbon.  
- Symbolizes the limits of human exploration and technology.
