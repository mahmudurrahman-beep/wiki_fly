# Space Missions

**Space missions** are scientific, exploratory, and commercial projects conducted by national and international space agencies to study outer space, planets, moons, asteroids, and beyond. They include both **crewed missions** (human spaceflight) and **uncrewed missions** (satellites, probes, rovers).

## Early Missions
- **Sputnik 1 (1957):** First artificial satellite, launched by the Soviet Union.  
- **Vostok 1 (1961):** First human in space, Yuri Gagarin.  
- **Apollo Program (1961–1972):** U.S. missions to the Moon; Apollo 11 (1969) achieved first human landing.  

## Major NASA Missions
- **Mercury & Gemini Programs (1960s):** Early U.S. human spaceflight.  
- **Apollo (1960s–70s):** Moon landings.  
- **Space Shuttle Program (1981–2011):** Reusable spacecraft for low Earth orbit.  
- **International Space Station (1998–present):** Multinational orbital laboratory.  
- **Mars Missions:** Viking (1970s), Spirit & Opportunity (2004), Curiosity (2012), Perseverance (2021).  
- **Outer Solar System:** Voyager 1 & 2 (1977), New Horizons (Pluto flyby 2015).  
- **Telescopes:** Hubble (1990), James Webb Space Telescope (2021).  

## Soviet/Russian Missions
- **Luna Program (1959–1976):** First lunar impact and sample return.  
- **Soyuz Program (1967–present):** Long-running human spaceflight program.  
- **Mir Space Station (1986–2001):** Predecessor to the ISS.  

## European Space Agency (ESA)
- **Rosetta (2004–2016):** Studied comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko.  
- **Mars Express (2003–present):** Orbital study of Mars.  
- **Gaia (2013–present):** Mapping billions of stars.  

## Other Agencies
- **China (CNSA):** Chang’e lunar missions, Tiangong space station, Mars rover Zhurong (2021).  
- **India (ISRO):** Chandrayaan lunar missions, Mangalyaan Mars Orbiter (2013).  
- **Japan (JAXA):** Hayabusa asteroid sample-return missions.  
- **Private Companies:** SpaceX (Falcon 9, Starship, Crew Dragon), Blue Origin, Rocket Lab.  

## Current and Upcoming Missions
- **Artemis Program (NASA):** Returning humans to the Moon (2020s).  
- **Mars Sample Return (NASA/ESA):** Planned for 2030s.  
- **JUICE (ESA, 2023):** Exploring Jupiter’s icy moons.  
- **Chinese Lunar South Pole Missions:** Planned for late 2020s.
