## Introduction
The **Talmud** is a central text of Judaism, comprising rabbinic discussions on law, ethics, customs, and history. It is considered the authoritative source of Jewish religious law (*Halakhah*) and tradition.

## History / Origins
- **Mishnah**: Compiled around **200 CE** by Rabbi Judah the Prince, summarizing oral laws.  
- **Gemara**: Rabbinic commentary and debate on the Mishnah, compiled between **400–600 CE**.  
- Two versions exist:  
  - **Babylonian Talmud (Talmud Bavli)** – completed around 500 CE, more comprehensive and widely studied.  
  - **Jerusalem Talmud (Talmud Yerushalmi)** – completed around 400 CE, shorter and less authoritative.  

## Key Features
- **Structure**: Divided into six orders (*Sedarim*) covering agriculture, festivals, marriage, civil law, temple service, and purity.  
- **Language**: Written in Hebrew and Aramaic.  
- **Content**: Legal rulings, ethical teachings, folklore, and philosophical discussions.  
- **Study Tradition**: Traditionally studied in pairs (*chevruta*), emphasizing debate and interpretation.  

## Legacy / Impact
- Serves as the foundation of Jewish law and practice.  
- Influenced Jewish thought, philosophy, and culture for centuries.  
- Studied worldwide in religious schools (*yeshivot*) and by scholars of religion and history.  
- Sometimes controversial due to its complexity and interpretations, but remains central to Jewish identity.  

## Fun Fact 🌟
The Talmud is so vast that traditional study can take **seven and a half years** to complete one cycle (*Daf Yomi*), with one page studied each day.
