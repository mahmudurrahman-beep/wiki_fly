# Python

**Python** is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language known for its simplicity, readability, and versatility. It is widely used in web development, data science, artificial intelligence, automation, and scientific computing.

## History
- Created by **Guido van Rossum** in **1991**.  
- Designed to emphasize **code readability** and a clean syntax.  
- Named after the British comedy group **Monty Python**, not the snake.  
- Maintained by the **Python Software Foundation (PSF)**.  
- Current major versions: **Python 2 (1991–2020)** and **Python 3 (2008–present)**.

## Key Features
- **Simple syntax:** Easy to learn and write, close to natural language.  
- **Interpreted language:** Runs directly without compilation.  
- **Cross-platform:** Works on Windows, macOS, Linux, and more.  
- **Extensive libraries:** Rich standard library and third-party packages (via **PyPI**).  
- **Object-oriented and functional:** Supports multiple programming paradigms.  
- **Dynamic typing:** Variables don’t need explicit type declarations.  
- **Community-driven:** Large global community and open-source ecosystem.

## Example
```python
# Hello World in Python
print("Hello, World!")

# Simple function
def greet(name):
