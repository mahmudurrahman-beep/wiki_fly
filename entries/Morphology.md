## Definition
**Morphology** is the study of form and structure. It has two major uses:
1. **Biology** – The study of the form, shape, and structure of organisms.  
2. **Linguistics** – The study of the structure of words and how they are formed.

## Morphology in Biology
- Focuses on the **size, shape, and arrangement** of organisms and their parts.  
- Includes external features (e.g., body shape, coloration) and internal structures (e.g., organs, tissues).  
- Helps classify species and understand evolutionary relationships.  
- Examples:
  - Comparative morphology (comparing structures across species).  
  - Functional morphology (studying how structures relate to function).  
  - Developmental morphology (studying changes during growth).

## Morphology in Linguistics
- Concerned with the **structure of words** and how they are built from smaller units called **morphemes**.  
- **Morphemes** are the smallest units of meaning (e.g., “un‑”, “happy”, “‑ness”).  
- Types of morphology:
  - **Inflectional** – Changes a word’s form to express grammar (e.g., *walk → walked*).  
  - **Derivational** – Creates new words (e.g., *happy → happiness*).  
- Important for understanding grammar, vocabulary, and language evolution.

## Importance
- In **biology**, morphology helps in taxonomy, evolutionary biology, and medical sciences.  
- In **linguistics**, morphology explains how languages form words and convey meaning.

*Morphology bridges science and language, describing how living beings and words take shape and evolve.*
