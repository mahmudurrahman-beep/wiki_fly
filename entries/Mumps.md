## Introduction
**Mumps** is a contagious viral disease caused by the **mumps virus**, a member of the paramyxovirus family. It primarily affects the salivary glands, leading to swelling and discomfort, but can also cause complications in other organs.

## History / Origins
- Known since ancient times as a childhood illness.  
- Became less common after the introduction of the **MMR vaccine** in the 1970s.  
- Outbreaks still occur in communities with low vaccination coverage.  

## Key Features
- **Symptoms**: Fever, headache, fatigue, loss of appetite, followed by swelling of the parotid salivary glands (causing puffy cheeks and jaw pain).  
- **Transmission**: Spread through saliva, coughing, sneezing, or sharing utensils.  
- **Incubation Period**: 2–4 weeks before symptoms appear.  
- **Complications**: Orchitis (testicular inflammation), oophoritis (ovarian inflammation), meningitis, pancreatitis, and hearing loss in rare cases.  

## Legacy / Impact
- Once a common childhood illness worldwide.  
- Now largely preventable through vaccination, though outbreaks still occur.  
- Remains a public health concern in areas with declining immunization rates.  

## Fun Fact 🌟
Before vaccines, mumps was one of the leading causes of childhood deafness.
