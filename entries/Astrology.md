## Definition
**Astrology** is a set of traditions and practices that claim to interpret the influence of stars, planets, and other celestial bodies on human affairs and natural events. While widely practiced, it is regarded as a **pseudoscience** by the scientific community.

## Historical Background
- Originated in **Babylon** around the 2nd millennium BCE.  
- Adopted by **Greek civilization** (Hellenistic astrology) and spread through the Roman Empire.  
- Influenced by **Islamic scholars** during the Middle Ages.  
- Integrated into **Indian (Vedic)** and **Chinese** traditions, each with unique systems.  

## Major Traditions
- **Western Astrology** – Based on the zodiac (12 signs: Aries to Pisces).  
- **Vedic (Hindu) Astrology** – Known as *Jyotisha*, emphasizes planetary periods (*dashas*) and lunar mansions (*nakshatras*).  
- **Chinese Astrology** – Uses a 12‑year cycle with animal signs (Rat, Ox, Tiger, etc.).  
- **Islamic & Medieval Astrology** – Influenced medicine, philosophy, and astronomy in Europe and the Middle East.  

## Core Concepts
- **Zodiac Signs** – 12 divisions of the ecliptic, each associated with personality traits.  
- **Planets** – Believed to influence behavior and destiny (e.g., Mercury for communication, Venus for love).  
- **Houses** – 12 sectors of the sky linked to life areas (career, family, relationships).  
- **Horoscopes** – Charts based on birth date, time, and location, used for predictions.  

## Modern Role
- Popular in horoscopes, personality readings, and cultural practices.  
- Used in lifestyle guidance, though not scientifically validated.  
- Continues to influence art, literature, and spirituality.  

## Criticism
- **Scientific View** – Astrology lacks empirical evidence and is considered pseudoscience.  
- Predictions are often vague and rely on psychological effects like the **Barnum effect** (people see general statements as personally meaningful).
