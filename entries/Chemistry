Chemistry is the branch of science concerned with the study of matter, its properties, composition, structure, and the changes it undergoes during chemical reactions. It connects physics, biology, and geology, and is often called the "central science."

## Historical Development

1. **Ancient Roots** – Early practices of alchemy in Egypt, Greece, India, and China.  
2. **17th Century** – Robert Boyle emphasized experimentation and defined elements.  
3. **18th Century** – Antoine Lavoisier established the law of conservation of mass.  
4. **19th Century** – John Dalton’s atomic theory; Dmitri Mendeleev’s periodic table.  
5. **20th Century** – Quantum chemistry, discovery of subatomic particles, and synthetic materials.  

## Major Branches

- **Organic Chemistry** – Study of carbon compounds, including fuels, plastics, and biomolecules.  
- **Inorganic Chemistry** – Study of minerals, metals, and non‑carbon compounds.  
- **Physical Chemistry** – Focus on energy, thermodynamics, and quantum mechanics in chemical systems.  
- **Analytical Chemistry** – Techniques for identifying and quantifying substances.  
- **Biochemistry** – Chemistry of living organisms, proteins, DNA, and metabolism.  

## Fundamental Concepts

- **Atoms and Molecules** – Basic units of matter.  
- **Periodic Table** – Organization of elements by atomic number and properties.  
- **Chemical Bonds** – Ionic, covalent, and metallic bonds.  
- **Reactions** – Processes where substances transform into new compounds.  
- **Stoichiometry** – Quantitative relationships in chemical equations.  

## Key Laws and Theories

1. **Law of Conservation of Mass** – Matter is neither created nor destroyed.  
2. **Atomic Theory** – All matter is composed of atoms.  
3. **Periodic Law** – Properties of elements are periodic functions of atomic number.  
4. **Chemical Kinetics** – Rates and mechanisms of reactions.  
5. **Thermodynamics** – Energy changes in chemical processes.  

## Applications

* Medicine – Drug design and pharmaceuticals.  
* Industry – Production of plastics, fertilizers, fuels.  
* Environment – Pollution control, green chemistry, renewable energy.  
* Everyday Life – Cooking, cleaning, materials, cosmetics.
