## Introduction
**Sufism** (Arabic: التصوف‎, *al‑Taṣawwuf*) is the mystical branch of Islam that focuses on inner spirituality, purification of the soul, and direct experience of God. Practitioners are known as **Sufis**.

## History / Origins
- Emerged in the early centuries of Islam (8th–9th century CE).  
- Rooted in Qur’anic teachings and the example of Prophet Muhammad’s simplicity and devotion.  
- Developed into organized brotherhoods called **tariqas** (orders), each with spiritual lineages.  
- Spread widely across the Muslim world, influencing art, poetry, and philosophy.  

## Key Features
- **Core Belief**: The ultimate goal is closeness to God (*fana’ fi Allah* — annihilation of the self in God).  
- **Practices**: Meditation, dhikr (remembrance of God), music, poetry, and ascetic living.  
- **Orders (Tariqas)**: Examples include the Qadiriyya, Naqshbandiyya, and Chishtiyya.  
- **Literature**: Rich tradition of mystical poetry by figures like **Rumi**, **Hafiz**, and **Rabia al‑Basri**.  
- **Symbols**: Whirling dervishes (Mevlevi order) are iconic representations of Sufi devotion.  

## Legacy / Impact
- Deeply influenced Islamic philosophy, art, and culture.  
- Promoted values of love, tolerance, and spiritual unity.
