## Introduction
**Coal** is a combustible black or brownish‑black sedimentary rock formed from ancient plant matter. It is primarily composed of carbon, along with hydrogen, sulfur, oxygen, and nitrogen. Coal has been a major source of energy for centuries, fueling industry, electricity, and transportation.

## History / Origins
- Formed millions of years ago during the **Carboniferous Period** (about 360–300 million years ago).  
- Used as fuel in China as early as **1000 BCE**.  
- Became central to the **Industrial Revolution** in the 18th and 19th centuries, powering steam engines and factories.  
- Remains one of the most widely used fossil fuels worldwide.  

## Key Features
- **Types of Coal**:  
  - **Anthracite** – highest carbon content, hardest, burns cleanest.  
  - **Bituminous** – widely used for electricity and steel production.  
  - **Sub‑bituminous** – lower carbon, used mainly for power generation.  
  - **Lignite** – lowest grade, soft and brown, least energy‑dense.  
- **Properties**: High energy content, solid fuel, relatively easy to mine.  
- **Uses**:  
  - Electricity generation (coal‑fired power plants).  
  - Steel production (coke from coal used in blast furnaces).  
  - Cement manufacturing.  
  - Historically used for heating and locomotives.  

## Legacy / Impact
- Fueled industrial growth and economic expansion worldwide.  
- Major contributor to **greenhouse gas emissions** and **climate change**.  
- Many countries are transitioning away from coal toward renewable energy.  
- Still significant in developing economies for affordable energy.  

## Fun Fact 🌟
Coal is sometimes called **“buried sunshine”** because it stores energy from ancient plants that captured sunlight millions of years ago.
