A **nuclear weapon** is an explosive device that derives its destructive force from nuclear reactions—either fission (splitting atomic nuclei) or a combination of fission and fusion (thermonuclear weapons). They are among the most powerful and controversial technologies ever developed.

## Origins and Development

- **1938** – Discovery of nuclear fission by Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann.  
- **1939–1945 (World War II)** – The Manhattan Project in the United States developed the first nuclear weapons.  
- **1945** – Atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan.  
- **Cold War Era** – Rapid expansion of nuclear arsenals by the U.S. and Soviet Union.  
- **Present Day** – Nine countries are known to possess nuclear weapons.  

## Types of Nuclear Weapons

1. **Atomic Bomb (Fission Weapon)**  
   - Uses nuclear fission to release energy.  
   - Example: Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs.  

2. **Hydrogen Bomb (Thermonuclear Weapon)**  
   - Combines fission and fusion for far greater explosive power.  
   - First tested in 1952 by the United States.  

3. **Tactical Nuclear Weapons**  
   - Smaller, battlefield‑use weapons.  

4. **Strategic Nuclear Weapons**  
   - Designed for large‑scale destruction, often delivered by missiles.  

## Effects

- **Blast** – Massive shockwave destroys structures.  
- **Heat** – Intense thermal radiation causes fires and burns.  
- **Radiation** – Immediate and long‑term health effects, including cancer.  
- **Fallout** – Radioactive particles contaminate air, soil, and water.  
- **Environmental Impact** – Potential for “nuclear winter” if many weapons are used.  

## Global Treaties and Control

- **Nuclear Non‑Proliferation Treaty (NPT, 1968)** – Limits spread of nuclear weapons.  
- **Comprehensive Nuclear‑Test‑Ban Treaty (CTBT, 1996)** – Bans nuclear test explosions.  
- **Strategic Arms Reduction Treaties (START)** – Reduce U.S. and Russian arsenals.  
- **International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)** – Monitors compliance and promotes peaceful nuclear use.  

## Countries with Nuclear Weapons

- United States  
- Russia  
- United Kingdom  
- France  
- China  
- India  
- Pakistan  
- North Korea  
- Israel (undeclared but widely believed)  

## Ethical and Political Issues

- **Deterrence** – Nuclear weapons prevent war through fear of retaliation.  
- **Proliferation** – Spread of nuclear technology raises global security risks.  
- **Disarmament** – Ongoing debates about eliminating nuclear arsenals.  
- **Humanitarian Concerns** – Civilian casualties and long‑term health effects.

*The existence of nuclear weapons continues to shape global politics, security strategies, and ethical debates, making them one of the most consequential inventions in human history.*
