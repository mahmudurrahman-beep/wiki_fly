## Introduction
**Economic liberalism** is a political and economic philosophy that advocates for an economy driven by **individual choice and market forces**, rather than heavy government regulation. It is closely associated with **classical economics** and the ideas of **Adam Smith**, who argued that the “invisible hand” of the market leads to efficient outcomes.
