## Definition
The **Kardashev Scale** is a method of measuring a civilization’s level of technological advancement based on the amount of energy it can harness and use. It was proposed in **1964** by Soviet astronomer **Nikolai Kardashev**.

## Types of Civilizations
| Type | Energy Source | Description |
|------|---------------|-------------|
| **Type I** | Planetary | Harnesses all available energy on its home planet (e.g., Earth’s wind, solar, fossil fuels). |
| **Type II** | Stellar | Captures the full energy output of its star (e.g., a Dyson Sphere around the Sun). |
| **Type III** | Galactic | Utilizes the energy of an entire galaxy, controlling billions of stars. |

## Humanity’s Current Status
- Earth is **not yet Type I**.  
- Current estimates place humanity at about **0.7 on the Kardashev Scale**.  
- We rely on a mix of renewable and non‑renewable energy, far below planetary maximum.  

## Applications
- Used in **SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence)** to classify potential alien civilizations.  
- Provides a framework for imagining future technological progress.  
- Highlights challenges of sustainability and energy expansion.  

## Extensions
- Some scientists propose **Type IV** (universal energy) and **Type V** (multiverse energy).  
- Modified scales also consider **information processing** and **technological efficiency**.

*The Kardashev Scale is both a scientific tool and a philosophical lens, helping us imagine humanity’s place in the cosmos and the potential of advanced civilizations.*
