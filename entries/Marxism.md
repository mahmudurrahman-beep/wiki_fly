## Introduction
**Marxism** is a political philosophy and socioeconomic theory developed by **Karl Marx** and **Friedrich Engels** in the 19th century. It interprets history through the lens of **class struggle** and emphasizes the role of material conditions in shaping society. Marxism critiques capitalism and envisions a transition toward socialism and ultimately a classless, communist society.

## History / Origins
- Originated in the works of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, particularly *The Communist Manifesto* (1848) and *Das Kapital* (1867).  
- Built on the idea of **historical materialism**, which sees economic production as the foundation of social and political life.  
- Influenced revolutionary movements worldwide, including the Russian Revolution (1917) and later socialist states.  

## Key Features
- **Class Struggle**: History is driven by conflict between the ruling class (bourgeoisie) and the working class (proletariat).  
- **Base and Superstructure**: Economic systems (base) shape culture, politics, and ideology (superstructure).  
- **Alienation**: Workers are alienated under capitalism, separated from the products of their labor.  
- **Communism**: The ultimate goal is a classless society with shared ownership of resources.  

## Legacy / Impact
- Inspired socialist and communist movements across the globe.  
- Influenced political theory, sociology, economics, and philosophy.  
- Remains a subject of debate, with critics highlighting authoritarian regimes that claimed Marxist foundations, while supporters emphasize its critique of inequality.
