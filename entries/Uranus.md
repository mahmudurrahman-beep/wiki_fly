## Introduction
Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun and classified as an **ice giant**. It is unique among the planets because it rotates on its side, with an axial tilt of about 98 degrees. Its pale blue-green color comes from methane in its atmosphere.

## History / Origins
- Discovered in **1781** by William Herschel, making it the first planet found with a telescope.  
- Originally thought to be a star or comet before its planetary nature was confirmed.  
- Named after **Uranus**, the Greek god of the sky.  

## Key Features
- Diameter: ~50,724 km (about 4 times Earth’s).  
- Atmosphere: Hydrogen, helium, methane.  
- Rings: Faint, dark rings discovered in 1977.  
- Moons: At least **27 known moons**, including Titania, Oberon, Umbriel, Ariel, and Miranda.  
- Rotation: Extreme tilt causes unusual seasons, with each pole experiencing 42 years of continuous sunlight or darkness.  

## Legacy / Impact
- Voyager 2 (1986) is the only spacecraft to have visited Uranus.  
- Its sideways rotation challenges planetary formation theories.  
- Studying Uranus helps scientists understand ice giants and exoplanets with similar characteristics.  

## Fun Fact 🌟
Uranus is the only planet that **spins on its side**, making its seasons last decades!
