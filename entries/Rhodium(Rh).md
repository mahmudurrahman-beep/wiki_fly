## Introduction
**Rhodium** is a chemical element with the symbol **Rh** and atomic number **45**. It is a rare, silvery‑white, hard, and corrosion‑resistant metal belonging to the platinum group. Rhodium is highly valued for its reflective properties and industrial applications.

## History / Origins
- Discovered in **1803** by English chemist **William Hyde Wollaston**, shortly after his discovery of palladium.  
- The name comes from the Greek word *rhodon* (“rose”), referring to the rose‑colored salts formed during its discovery.  
- Found in ores of platinum and nickel, often as a by‑product of mining.  

## Key Features

- **Properties**: Hard, durable, resistant to corrosion, and maintains luster at high temperatures.  
- **Occurrence**: Extremely rare, with major deposits in South Africa, Russia, and Canada.  
- **Uses**:  
  - Catalytic converters in automobiles (reduces harmful emissions).  
  - Jewelry plating (especially white gold for a reflective finish).  
  - Electrical contacts and optical instruments.  
  - High‑temperature and corrosion‑resistant alloys.  

## Legacy / Impact
- Considered one of the most valuable precious metals due to rarity and demand.  
- Plays a critical role in reducing vehicle pollution worldwide.  
- Used in luxury goods for its brilliant shine and durability.  
- Prices can fluctuate dramatically due to limited supply and industrial demand.  

## Fun Fact 🌟
Rhodium is the **most expensive precious metal** in the world, often trading higher than gold and platinum.
