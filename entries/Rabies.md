## Introduction
**Rabies** is a viral disease caused by the **rabies virus**, a member of the *Lyssavirus* genus. It affects mammals, including humans, and is one of the oldest known zoonotic diseases.

## History / Origins
- Known since antiquity; references to rabies appear in Mesopotamian texts.  
- The virus was identified in the 19th century.  
- **Louis Pasteur** developed the first rabies vaccine in **1885**, revolutionizing prevention.  

## Key Features
- **Transmission**: Through saliva of infected animals, usually via bites.  
- **Reservoirs**: Dogs, bats, raccoons, foxes, and other mammals.  
- **Symptoms**: Fever, headache, anxiety, confusion, hydrophobia (fear of water), paralysis, and eventually coma and death.  
- **Incubation Period**: Typically 1–3 months, but can vary from days to years.  
- **Treatment**: Once symptoms appear, rabies is almost always fatal. Post‑exposure prophylaxis (PEP) with rabies vaccine and immunoglobulin can prevent disease if given promptly.  

## Legacy / Impact
- Rabies causes tens of thousands of deaths annually, mostly in Asia and Africa.  
- Global vaccination campaigns for dogs have significantly reduced human cases.  
- Still considered a major public health issue in regions with poor access to vaccines.  

## Fun Fact 🌟
The word “rabies” comes from the Latin *rabere*, meaning “to rage” — reflecting the furious behavior seen in infected animals.
