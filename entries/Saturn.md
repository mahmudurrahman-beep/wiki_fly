## Introduction
Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System. Known for its spectacular ring system, it is a gas giant composed mostly of hydrogen and helium.

## History / Origins
- Observed since ancient times by Babylonian and Roman astronomers.
- Named after the Roman god of agriculture.
- First studied with telescopes by Galileo in 1610, who thought the rings were moons.

## Key Features
- Diameter: ~120,536 km.
- Rings: Made of ice and rock particles, stretching hundreds of thousands of kilometers.
- Moons: Over 140 confirmed, including Titan (larger than Mercury).
- Density: Only 0.687 g/cm³ — less than water.

## Legacy / Impact
- Saturn’s rings and moons are central to planetary science.
- Missions like Voyager and Cassini revealed its complex atmosphere and ring dynamics.
- Titan is a prime candidate for studying prebiotic chemistry.

## Fun Fact 🌟
Saturn is so light for its size that it would **float in water** if you could find a cosmic bathtub!
