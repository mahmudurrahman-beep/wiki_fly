## Introduction
Venus is the second planet from the Sun and often called Earth’s “sister planet” due to its similar size and composition. It has a thick atmosphere that traps heat, making it the hottest planet in the Solar System.

## History / Origins
- Known since antiquity; visible as the “morning star” or “evening star.”  
- Named after **Venus**, the Roman goddess of love and beauty.  
- Studied by spacecraft such as **Magellan**, **Venus Express**, and **Akatsuki**.  

## Key Features
- Diameter: ~12,104 km.  
- Atmosphere: Dense, mostly carbon dioxide, with clouds of sulfuric acid.  
- Surface: Volcanic plains, mountains, and craters.  
- Rotation: Retrograde (spins opposite to most planets), with a day lasting **243 Earth days**.  

## Legacy / Impact
- Venus’s runaway greenhouse effect is a cautionary example for climate science.  
- Missions continue to study its atmosphere and geology for insights into planetary evolution.  

## Fun Fact 🌟
A year on Venus is shorter than a day — **225 Earth days for a year**, but **243 Earth days for a day**!
