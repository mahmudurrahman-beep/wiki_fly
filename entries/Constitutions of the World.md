Constitutions are the fundamental legal documents that define the structure of government, the distribution of powers, and the rights of citizens. They serve as the supreme law of a state and provide the framework for political and administrative governance.

## Historical Origins

1. **Ancient Roots** – Early constitutional ideas can be traced to Greek city‑states and Roman law.  
2. **Magna Carta (1215)** – Established limits on monarchical power in England.  
3. **Modern Constitutions** – The U.S. Constitution (1787) and French Constitution (1791) pioneered written constitutional frameworks.  
4. **Global Spread** – By the 20th century, most independent states adopted written constitutions.

## Key Features of Constitutions

2. **Unwritten Constitutions** – Based on statutes, conventions, and precedents (e.g., United Kingdom).
