## Introduction
Neptune is the eighth and farthest planet from the Sun in the Solar System. Classified as an **ice giant**, it is known for its deep blue color caused by methane in its atmosphere. Neptune is similar in composition to Uranus but more active, with powerful storms and high-speed winds.

## History / Origins
- Predicted mathematically before it was observed, due to irregularities in Uranus’s orbit.  
- Discovered in **1846** by Johann Galle, based on calculations by Urbain Le Verrier.  
- Named after **Neptune**, the Roman god of the sea.  

## Key Features
- Diameter: ~49,244 km (about 4 times Earth’s).  
- Atmosphere: Hydrogen, helium, methane.  
- Winds: Fastest in the Solar System, reaching up to **2,100 km/h**.  
- Moons: At least **14 known moons**, the largest being **Triton**, which orbits in the opposite direction of Neptune’s rotation.  
- Rings: Faint, dark rings composed of dust and ice particles.  

## Legacy / Impact
- Voyager 2 (1989) remains the only spacecraft to have visited Neptune.  
- Triton is considered a captured Kuiper Belt object, making it unique among large moons.  
- Neptune’s study helps scientists understand ice giants and exoplanets with similar compositions.  

## Fun Fact 🌟
Neptune’s winds are so extreme that they blow **faster than the speed of sound** on Earth!
