## Foundation
- Established by **Tokugawa Ieyasu** in 1603 after victory at the **Battle of Sekigahara (1600)**.  
- Capital: **Edo (modern Tokyo)**.  
- Emperor remained a symbolic figure in Kyoto, while the shogun held real power.  

## Political & Social System
- **Feudal hierarchy:** Shogun → Daimyo (lords) → Samurai → Peasants → Artisans → Merchants.  
- Strict social order froze class mobility.  
- Daimyo were controlled through the **alternate attendance system (sankin-kōtai)**, requiring them to spend time in Edo.  

## Key Policies
- **Sakoku (1635):** Isolationist policy restricting foreign trade and contact, except limited Dutch and Chinese trade at Nagasaki.  
- Christianity was banned.  
- Internal peace allowed economic growth, urbanization, and cultural flourishing.  

## Culture & Economy
- Rise of **Kabuki theater**, **ukiyo-e woodblock prints**, and haiku poetry.  
- Edo became one of the world’s largest cities.  
- Agricultural improvements and merchant wealth expanded prosperity.  

## Decline
- Western powers forced Japan to open trade (Treaty of Kanagawa, 1854).  
- Internal unrest and modernization pressures weakened the shogunate.  
- **Tokugawa Yoshinobu**, the last shogun, resigned in 1867.  
- **Meiji Restoration (1868):** Restored imperial rule, ending feudal Japan.  

## Legacy
- Longest-lasting shogunate in Japanese history.  
- Remembered for peace, cultural growth, and isolation.  
- Its end marked Japan’s rapid modernization and entry into the global stage.
