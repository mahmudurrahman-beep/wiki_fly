## Introduction
**Cancer** is a generic term for a large group of diseases characterized by uncontrolled cell growth and the ability of these cells to invade or spread to other parts of the body. It can start almost anywhere in the human body, which is made up of trillions of cells.

## History / Origins
- The disease has been known since antiquity; Hippocrates described tumors as “karkinos” (Greek for crab).  
- Modern cancer research began in the 19th century with advances in pathology, surgery, and later chemotherapy.  
- Today, cancer is studied at the molecular level, focusing on genetics, mutations, and immune responses.  

## Key Features
- **Cause**: Genetic mutations disrupt normal cell division, leading to uncontrolled growth.  
- **Types**: Common cancers include breast, lung, colon, rectum, and prostate.  
- **Symptoms**: Vary widely — lumps, fatigue, weight loss, organ dysfunction.  
- **Risk Factors**: Tobacco use, obesity, alcohol consumption, poor diet, lack of physical activity, infections (HPV, hepatitis), and air pollution.  
- **Treatment**: Surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy, and targeted drugs.  

## Legacy / Impact
- **Global Burden**: Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for nearly one in six deaths.  
- **Prevention**: Many cancers can be prevented through lifestyle changes and vaccination (e.g., HPV vaccine).  
- **Research**: Advances in early detection and personalized medicine continue to improve survival rates.  

## Fun Fact 🌟
Not all tumors are cancer — **benign tumors** do not spread or invade other tissues, while **malignant tumors** are cancerous and can be life-threatening.
