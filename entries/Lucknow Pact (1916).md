## Definition
The **Lucknow Pact** was an agreement reached at a joint session of the **Indian National Congress** and the **All‑India Muslim League** in **Lucknow, December 1916**. It marked a rare moment of Hindu‑Muslim unity in the struggle against British colonial rule.

## Background
- The British government faced growing pressure from Indians demanding reforms.  
- The Congress sought broader representation and autonomy.  
- The Muslim League, under **Muhammad Ali Jinnah**, shifted from loyalty to the British toward cooperation with Congress.  
- **Bal Gangadhar Tilak** represented the Congress in negotiations.  

## Key Provisions
- **Separate Electorates** – Muslims were granted separate electorates in provincial legislatures.  
- **Minority Representation** – Religious minorities were assured representation.  
- **Joint Demands** – Both parties demanded greater Indian participation in governance, including more elected members in legislative councils.  
- **Unity Against British Rule** – Congress and Muslim League agreed to cooperate in pressing for constitutional reforms.  

## Significance
- First major political understanding between Hindus and Muslims in India.  
- Strengthened the demand for **Indian self‑government**.  
- Elevated **Muhammad Ali Jinnah’s role** as a key political leader.  
- Demonstrated the possibility of joint action against colonial policies.  

## Legacy
- The pact is remembered as a milestone of **nationalist unity**.  
- However, the cooperation was short‑lived; later divisions between Congress and Muslim League resurfaced.  
- Still, it remains a symbol of collaboration in India’s independence movement.
