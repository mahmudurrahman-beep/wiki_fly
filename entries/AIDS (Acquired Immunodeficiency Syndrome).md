## Introduction
**AIDS** is a disease caused by the **Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)**. HIV attacks the body’s immune system, specifically the CD4 cells (T cells), making individuals vulnerable to infections and certain cancers. Without treatment, HIV infection progresses to AIDS, the most severe stage.

## History / Origins
- First recognized in **1981** in the United States when unusual infections appeared among young men.  
- HIV was identified as the cause in **1983**.  
- Quickly became a global epidemic, especially in sub-Saharan Africa.  

## Key Features
- **Cause**: HIV infection leading to immune system collapse.  
- **Transmission**: Spread through blood, sexual contact, mother-to-child (pregnancy, childbirth, breastfeeding), and contaminated needles.  
- **Symptoms**: Severe immune deficiency, opportunistic infections (like tuberculosis, pneumonia, Kaposi’s sarcoma), weight loss, fever, night sweats.  
- **Treatment**: Antiretroviral therapy (ART) — daily medication that controls HIV, prevents progression to AIDS, and reduces transmission risk.  
- **Prevention**: Safe sex practices, needle exchange programs, HIV testing, and preventive medications (PrEP).  

## Legacy / Impact
- AIDS has claimed over **44 million lives globally** to date.  
- As of 2024, about **40.8 million people** were living with HIV worldwide.  
- Once considered a death sentence, HIV/AIDS is now a **manageable chronic condition** with ART.  
- Sparked major public health campaigns, global cooperation, and awareness of sexual health.  

## Fun Fact 🌟
When taken consistently, **ART can reduce HIV transmission through sex to nearly zero**, allowing HIV-positive individuals to live long, healthy lives.
